# Merkle-Tree-Root
The input transactions are read from a file named "input.txt" and are converted from hex-encoded format to byte slices. The Merkle Tree Root is computed using the 'computeMerkleRoot' function which uses SHA-256 hashing to compute the intermediate nodes and the root of the Merkle Tree. Finally, the root is printed in hex-encoded format.
